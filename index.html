        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p >As a dedicated Design and Arts Practitioner, my academic and professional journey has been centered around interactive animation, user experience and interface design, narrative dynamics, and immersive storytelling.<br></br> My initial exploration in film and theater arts led to a role at ExStorm, where I innovated with AR technology in marketing. My skills further developed at Tsinghua University, where I delved into game concept design with a focus on social responsibility.

            <br></br>Transitioning to MRGY, I specialized in scene conception and multimedia design, contributing significantly to visual design for Chinese stage performances, including a major opera TV show in 2023. This role marked a pivotal expansion in my expertise from graphic design to dynamic stage visuals.
            
            <br></br>Enhancing my technical abilities, I pursued further education at Sheridan College's Interactive Media Management program, mastering web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, particularly in ZIM for web and mobile applications. My passion lies in the intersection of storytelling, games, and animations, driving my ambition to explore advanced 3D animations and visual effects in virtual reality.</p>

            <h3>Multimedia Designer at MRGY</h3>
            <p>Mar 2023 – Aug 2023</p>
            <p>My job experience at MRGY marked a significant shift in my career towards scene conception and multimedia design and creation. Tasked with creating dynamic visual designs for major Chinese stage performances and cultural tourism, my role encompassed early-stage design, conceptual art, and animation storyboarding. 

                <br></br>Notably, in 2023, I played a pivotal role in the visual design of a traditional Chinese opera TV show, an experience that deepened my understanding of the transition from graphic design to three-dimensional dynamics and live-stage visual presentation.</p>

            <p>

                I designed the IP image and other preliminary planning and design for the New Year activities of Zhuhai Hengqin Innovation Square cultural tourism project.
                
                <br></br>And I came up with some creative solutions to enhance the company's brand image, using some interactive technologies to enhance the experience of the office space, breaking through the limitations of traditional brand design, and using AR technology, among others, to bring a new experience to the office space. <br></br>In my later work, I also keeps learning new media, such as generative art, which gives new sensory experiences to brand promotion visuals. 
                
                In the process of designing the 2022 calendar cultural and creative products for the company, I proposed a creative conceptual design and actively contacted the production suppliers who could provide the design to meet the needs, and finally, the products were produced as gifts for the company's partners.</p>
